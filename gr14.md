# GR14 spend proposal for LexDAO

We're a legal engineering guild, so please consider the following from the perspective of "does this support the legal engineering profession?"

## reasons

Because of GR14, we have a $55555 xDAI budget to spend on public goods this quarter.

Moreover, we should spend this budget on public goods the Gitcoin ecosystem finds high value.

The reason we should spend all of GR14 within a quarter is GR15 is just a quarter away and we have a chance in GR15 to receive a grant as large or larger if we get impressive traction from using the GR14 grant as working capital.

GR14 aside, our treasury is well stocked so we have no worries there.

### vision

We eventually become the Gitcoin grant 2.0 administrator for legal engineering and legal technology quadratic funding "QF" mechanisms. Compare City3 in the resources below.

## considerations

### purpose

Let's budget for spending $18000 per month this quarter!!

Most of the funds should go to new efforts rather than increasing rewards for existing efforts, since existing efforts are already active. 

However, sometimes great efforts get abandoned because contributors don't have enough resources to continue them.

Also, we received this much because of the crypto advocacy round. So lets spend as much as possible on advocacy.

## governance

Another important result here is we develop sound governance processes so that we can successfully:

* distribute large sums within the DAO
* scale the DAO,  including the future possibility we expand as fractal subDAOs

We might not get there this quarter. If we can ever completely get there. It's not an easy problem. As such, we should probable experiment with a few tools:

* tokenstream.party
* coordinape
* dework

## Kali & Curia

### audits

Ross opines here. 

## Clinic

Legal aid services (not advice) for impact DAOs using the student + supervisor model. Also Ethereum standards for applied legal engineering education. 

The Clinic makes some money and has the potential to make much more money. 

So money granted to the Clinic might be recouped, might become a flywheel.

### operator & establisher

bestape already receives $1000/month from LexDAO for operating the Clinic. 

bestape would like $1000/month extra from the GR14 grant to further establish the Clinic. 

At this early stage, establishing is very time intensive.

He's not contributing as much time establishing as he should. 

An extra $1000/month would free him up to spend enough time continuing to establish the Clinic.

### supervisor & student bounties

$5000/month to compensate supervisors & students for their time working in the Clinic. 

This $5000 will be tracked through Dework bounties, though we might use coordinape and tokenstream.party too.

bestape will perform his EIP supervisor work *pro bono*. 

## Website Overhaul

Website overhaul proposal is underway from Andres and Cimply. 

Shiv has been onboarded and quoted $150/hr for 10-12 hours of work to get features online.

Features include:

1. Law library integrated;
2. All governance docs, decisions and disbursements on one display;
3. Socials tab for substack, twitter, discord and discourse;
4. Calendar for Twitter spaces, AMAs and other events like study group, hack calls, And governance calls;
5. Organized page for SubDAOs and T2 projects like Kali, Curia, LawLibrary, RWA, and Web3 Music;
6. Coherent and consistent aesthetic design and NFT gated features TBD.

## brand

### merch

Likely recoupable + flywheel.

bestape will reach out to MetaFactory and maybe others to create based merch for dripping vibes. 

This project should bring capital to the DAO in sum but there might be initial costs, estimated at $400/month.

bestape will perform merch work *gratis*.


## Web3 Music Coalition

Legal wrapper for copyright. Compare KALI as legal wrapper for legal entity.

### operator & establisher

bestape hasn't yet received any compensation operating or establishing the Coalition, currently a tier 1 LexDAO project.

The Coalition has brought in some funding here https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xE83a67025D708c7F8Ef9026fC82A71491e24D3F1 but we intend to spend that on grants for delegates attending music industry events, including retroactive grants.

The Coalition is still building out, with some copyright IP focused LexDAO members from ECTA and Royal (prev. Kobalt) recently joining in. 

Importantly, the Coalition is now working with https://DDEX.net to integrate their standards -- which effectively manage the entire existing music industry's royalty system DEX -- with EVM products such as NFT.

Now that the Coalition has matured into building what will hopefully become an important EIP public good, bestape would like to get paid $2000/month to operate and establish the Coalition.

## grants

Recoupable + flywheel.

### operator

GR14 success has shown spending time on grants pays off. 

bestape is continuing to work on grants, including staying up-to-date with Gitcoin changes (e.g. GTC staking and attending MCON2) as well as expanding to other platforms such as Giveth and Endaoment.

bestape would like to get paid $1000/month to continue operating grants.

## totals

* Kali & Curia audits: $?/month;
* Clinic supervisor & student bounties, recoupable: $5000/month
* bestape's transition to full-time LexDAO core contributor, recoupable: $4000/month;
* LexDAO NEW website: $2,200 one-time costs, $250-300/month onwards or roughly $1000/month;
* projected merch costs, recoupable: $400/month;
* remaining: $8000/month;

## governance

At this phase of the DAO's life cycle, it might be best if no DAO contributor can receive over $5000/month in income from the DAO. Also because we're a non-profit club.
